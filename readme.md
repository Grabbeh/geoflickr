Geophoto
=========

Geophoto simply uses the Flickr and Google Maps APIs to allow you to search for photos of cats or otherwise, on a geographical basis. 

Special mention to Ciaran Jessup's [Flickrnode](https://github.com/ciaranj/flickrnode) library used to allow interaction with Flickr's API through Node.js. 

Previously built with jQuery, it's now been refactored to use Angular.js.
