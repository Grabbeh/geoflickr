**Geoflickr**

Geoflickr simply uses the Flickr and Google Maps APIs to allow you to search for photos of cats or otherwise, on a geographical basis. 

Kindly uses Ciaran Jessup's [Flickrnode](https://github.com/ciaranj/flickrnode) to allow interaction with Flickr's API with Node.js. 

The code is a bit of a jQuery jumble on the front-end. I'd love to refactor into Angular but need to get a grasp of AngularJS directives in Google Maps first...

Pull requests welcome :)
