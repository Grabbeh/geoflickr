Geoflickr
=========

Geoflickr simply uses the Flickr and Google Maps APIs to allow you to search for photos of cats or otherwise, on a geographical basis. 

Special mention to Ciaran Jessup's [Flickrnode](https://github.com/ciaranj/flickrnode) library used to allow interaction with Flickr's API through Node.js. 

I'm currently refactoring the code from jQuery to Angular.js so it isn't functional at the moment (although the site is still working).
